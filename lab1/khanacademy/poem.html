        <h1>A Bird, came down the Walk</h1>
        <p>
        A Bird, came down the Walk - <br>
        He did not know I saw - <br>
        He bit an Angle Worm in halves <br>
        And ate the fellow, raw, <br>
        <br>
        And then, he drank a Dew <br>
        From a convenient Grass - <br>
        And then hopped sidewise to the Wall <br>
        To let a Beetle pass -
