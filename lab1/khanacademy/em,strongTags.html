        Nobody’s born smart. <em>We all start at 0.</em> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <em>we are born to learn.</em><br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br></strong>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <strong>One foot in front of the other. <em>One idea on top of the next.</em><br></strong>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em><strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong></em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>You only have to know one thing:<br></em>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
